"""
Consider an n \times n grid whose squares may have traps. It is not allowed to move to a square with a trap.

Your task is to calculate the number of paths from the upper-left square to the lower-right square. You can only move right or down.

Input
    
    The first input line has an integer n: the size of the grid.
    
    After this, there are n lines that describe the grid. Each line has n characters: . denotes an empty cell, and * denotes a trap.

Output

    Print the number of paths modulo 10^9+7.

Constraints

    1 <= n <= 1000

Example

    Input:
    4
    ....
    .*..
    ...*
    *...

    Output:
    3
