"""
Given a string s and a dictionary of strings wordDict, return true if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

Note that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.

Example 1:

    Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet","code"]
    Output: true
    Explanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".

Example 2:

    Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple","pen"]
    Output: true
    Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".
    Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.

Example 3:

    Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats","dog","sand","and","cat"]
    Output: false
